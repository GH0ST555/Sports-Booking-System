# Risk Mitigation Plan:
## The Team has gathered during the first group discussion to follow a few principles to address the risks identified:
* Meet Regularly ideally more than the required sprint start and end meetings to be able to address any issues team members are facing and to be able to discuss progress.
* Members who were not familiar with flask are learning from the module content from the Web Application Development module to familiarise with the working of flask.
* Front End team has committed to learn advanced styling techniques.
* Back End team has committed to learn more about containers and advanced applications of flask such as API integration to be able to adopt a microservice approach for this project.  
* Microsoft Teams is being utilised for communication bewteen team members and team members are actively raising issues on the github isssue tracker.

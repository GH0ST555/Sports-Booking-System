4. Discussion of Progress<br>
* Advanced Login Feature. <br>
* Appropriate database implementation.<br>
* Knowledge of Flask with Aaditya and Swayam. <br>
* Knowledge acquired on how payments can be implemented using Stripe Api. However, it needs to be more dynamic instead of hardcoding using dictionaries, relevant fields from the database should be used to access data. <br>


5. Risks and Issues<br>
* Styling for Login and Sign up pages are behind schedule. It is suggested that a team member who has a responsibility to style these templates needs to immediately pick up the necessary skills and consult with other team members.<br>
* Many features from backlogs still not implemented. Went out of scope to make Login Advanced. <br>

4. Discussion of Progress<br>
* Database is integrated to the Stripe payment checkout sessions for one-time payments and subscriptions. <br>
* Fully functioning Management Interface (Admin Views). <br>
* Smart booking system <br> 


5. Risks and Issues<br>
* A different member is delegated to design a Login and Signup pages because the output from a team member who was assigned was unsatisfactory. <br>
* One of the team members has merged into a "main" branch from their branch they were working from which was significantly behind in commits, thus resulting in loss of progress in the "main" branch. Therefore, we have agreed to restrict the permissions to this users and other members of the team will now manually review the code before allowing to merge. <br>
